The GenoquantR.py source file is this project's first experimental version of a python script that would call R functions and 
quantify qPCR data. It is written in Python 2.7; the rest of the code in this project is going to be written in python 3.4, so be awair that his is
effectively a legacy file that will not be used in the future.
